The ``lino-avanti`` package
===========================




Lino Avanti is a free `Lino <http://www.lino-framework.org/>`_
application used by social workers in eastern Belgium for helping
immigrants with their *integration course*.

The **integration course** is an administrative procedure consisting
in an individual mentoring and a series of courses with the goal of
welcoming new residents and helping them to acquire the base knowledge
about society and social relations in Belgium in order to ease their
integration on the territory (summary from `Parcours d’intégration des
primo-arrivants
<http://socialsante.wallonie.be/?q=action-sociale/integration-personne-origine-etrangere/dispositifs/parcours-integration-primo-arrivant>`__).

Lino Avanti is being developed by the Ministery of the
`German-speaking Community of Belgium
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-speaking_Community_of_Belgium>`__
(MSG).
